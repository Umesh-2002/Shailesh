    <p>1.UP :Up told a better love story in ten minutes than most authors can do in 100 pages. Now that that matter is out of the way, it's certainly no wonder that it brought in such an impressive figure. The tale of Carl and Russell's adventure to Paradise Falls in a flying house is certainly one Pixar movie that stands out above the rest. With its emotional storytelling, absurdist humor, and a delightful soundtrack by Michael Giachino, one can understand why it was given such amazing acclaim.</p>

    <p>3.BIG HERO 6 :&emsp;Who would have guessed that a nearly forgotten Marvel miniseries could have spawned one of the most successful Disney features in history? The film could practically exist in the highly beloved MCU, Stan Lee cameo included! Pair those elements with a message about handling grief, mental health, and the importance of emotional well-being, and the result is worthy of being called a comic-book-movie masterpiece.</p>

    <p>4.MONSTER UNIVERSITY :&emsp;On one hand, who on earth asked for a G-rated version of Animal House? But on the other, who would have known that a college-focused prequel to Pixar's Monsters Inc. would bring in such a large profit?
